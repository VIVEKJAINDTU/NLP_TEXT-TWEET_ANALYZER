# **Tweet Analyzer Project**      
**Overview**  
The Tweet Analyzer project is a machine learning-based tool designed to analyze and classify Twitter tweets using the TF-IDF vectorizer and a Random Forest classification algorithm. This project allows users to understand the sentiment of tweets, making it useful for sentiment analysis and related tasks.   

**Features**      
+ Tweet Sentiment Analysis: The core functionality of the project is to analyze the sentiment of Twitter tweets, categorizing them into positive, negative, or neutral classes.       

+ TF-IDF Vectorization: The project utilizes the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization technique to convert the raw text data of tweets into numerical features for machine learning.      

+ Random Forest Classification: The TF-IDF features are then used to train a Random Forest classifier for sentiment classification.      

**Deployment**       
The project is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the tweet analyzer. Users can input a tweet, and the system will provide the predicted sentiment category.
